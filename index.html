      The great Himalayas are one of the best gifts of nature to mankind. This mountainous range is an earthly example of what heaven really looks and
      feels like.From thick woodlands to lavish valleys, from tropical wildernesses to compelling slopes, from various types of verdures to the
      sentimental climate, the Himalayan ranges have it all.If, by any chance, you get to visit the Himalayas just once you will be able to deduce why 
      it's known as the heaven on earth. We step into Himalayan kingdom wonderstruck every time how boundlessly nature has gifted these terrains with
      beauty and resources. Mile after mile of never-ending virgin greens, the clean air full of oxygen, mineral-rich waters of mountain streams,
      wildflower carpet and strawberry shrubsâ€”suddenly it is inexhaustible life all around!
